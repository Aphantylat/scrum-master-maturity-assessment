# Scrum Master Maturity Assessment

This project provides an interactive web-based assessment to help Scrum Masters understand their current level of expertise and identify areas for professional development. The assessment is inspired by the "Evolution of the Scrum Master" article by Ron Eringa.

## Overview

The Scrum Master Maturity Assessment is a fun and insightful tool that allows Scrum Masters to evaluate their skills and growth potential. By answering a series of questions, users will receive personalized feedback on their Scrum Master "level," ranging from Clerk to Expert, along with suggestions for improvement.

The assessment is designed to be engaging and lighthearted, using references to the popular animated TV series "South Park" to illustrate the different Scrum Master maturity stages.

## Features

- Interactive quiz with multiple-choice questions
- Personalized results showing the user's Scrum Master level
- Detailed descriptions of each level, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement
- Ability to share assessment results on LinkedIn
- Option to provide feedback and receive updates on the assessment

## Getting Started
